# Fraction fields

Nemo allows the creation of fraction fields over any ring $R$. We don't require
$R$ to be an integral domain, however no attempt is made to deal with the
general case. Two fractions $a/b$ and $c/d$ are equal in Nemo iff $ad = bc$.
Thus, in practice, a greatest common divisor function is currently required for
the ring $R$.

In order to make the representation $a/b$ unique for printing, we have a notion
of canonical unit for elements of a ring $R$. When canonicalising $a/b$, each
of the elements $a$ and $b$ is first divided by the canonical unit of $b$.

The `canonical_unit` function is defined for elements of every Nemo ring. It
must have the properties

```julia
canonical_unit(u) == u
canonical_unit(a*b) == canonical_unit(a)*canonical_unit(b)
```

for any unit $u$ of the ring in question, and $a$ and $b$ arbitrary elements
of the ring.

For example, the canonical unit of an integer is its sign. Thus a fraction of
integers always has positive denominator after canonicalisation.

The canonical unit of a polynomial is the canonical unit of its leading
coefficient, etc.

There are two different kinds of implementation of fraction fields in Nemo: a
generic one for the case where no specific implementation exists (provided by
AbstractAlgebra.jl), and efficient implementations of fractions over specific rings,
usually provided by C/C++ libraries.

The following table shows each of the fraction types available in Nemo, the
base ring $R$, and the Julia/Nemo types for that kind of fraction (the type
information is mainly of concern to developers).

Base ring        | Library            | Element type               | Parent type
-----------------|--------------------|----------------------------|----------------------
Generic ring $R$ | AbstractAlgebra.jl | `Generic.FracFieldElem{T}` | `Generic.FracField{T}`
$\mathbb{Z}$     | Flint              | `QQFieldElem`              | `QQField`

All fraction element types belong to the abstract type `FracElem` and all of
the fraction field types belong to the abstract type `FracField`. This enables
one to write generic functions that can accept any Nemo fraction type.

## Fraction functionality

All fraction types in Nemo provide functionality for fields described in
AbstractAlgebra.jl:

In addition all the fraction field functionality of AbstractAlgebra.jl is provided,
along with generic fractions fields as described here:
