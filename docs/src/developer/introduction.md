# Introduction to Nemo development

## Relationship to AbstractAlgebra.jl

Some time in the past, Nemo was split into two packages called Nemo.jl and
AbstractAlgebra.jl. The purpose was to provide a Julia only package which
did some subset of what Nemo could do, albeit slower. This was requested by
people in the Julia community.

Unfortunately, this hasn't been terribly successful. Most Julia developers
expect that AbstractAlgebra and Nemo functionality will work for Julia
matrices over AbstractAlgebra/Nemo rings. This would be possible for
functions that do not conflict with `Base` or `LinearAlgebra`, at least
when working with non-empty matrices. However, for reasons that we explain
in both the Appendix to the AbstractAlgebra package and in the parent object
section of the developer documentation, this is not possible, even in theory,
for functions that would conflict with Julia's standard library or for empty
matrices (except in a limited number of special cases).

Unfortunately, the Julia standard library functions do not work with matrices
of Nemo objects and there is little we can do about this. Moreover, some Julia
functionality isn't supported by the underlying C libraries in Nemo and would
be difficult or impossible to provide on the C side.

Nowadays we see AbstractAlgebra to provide three things to Nemo:

* An abstract type hierarchy
* Generic ring constructions, e.g. generic polynomials and matrices
* Generic implementations that should work for any ring implementing the
  required interfaces. These interfaces are documented in the AbstractAlgebra
  documentation.

Nemo itself is more or less just a wrapper of the C library FLINT, which provides highly optimised implementations of commonly used rings.

Each ring implemented in FLINT is wrapped in such a way as to
implement the interfaces described by AbstractAlgebra.

Most of the time an AbstractAlgebra implementation will work just as well
as using Nemo, but the latter will usually be faster, due to the extremely
performant C code (around half a million lines of it).

## Layout of files

Before FLINT v3, the content of FLINT was split into a number of separate libraries:

* FLINT : polynomials and matrices over Z, Q, Z/nZ, Qp, Fq
* Arb : polynomials, matrices and special functions over balls over R and C
* Antic : algebraic number field element arithmetic
* Calcium : exact real and complex numbers, including algebraic numbers

This historical fact is the reason why Nemo's `src` directory contains subdirectories `flint`, `arb`, `antic` and `calcium`. Each of these directories contains the wrappers for functionality that used to be in the C library its name indicates. The `test` directory is similarly organised.

Within each of these directories is a set of files, one per module within
the C libraries, e.g. the `fmpz.jl` file wraps the FLINT `fmpz` module for
multiple precision integers. The `fmpz_poly.jl` file wraps the FLINT
univariate polynomials over `fmpz` integers, and so on.

The `fmpq` prefix is for FLINT rationals, `fq` for FLINT finite fields with
multiprecision characteristic, `fq_nmod` is the same but for single word
characteristic. The `padic` prefix is for the field of p-adic numbers for a
given `p`. The `nmod` prefix is for `Z/nZ` for a given `n`. The `gfp` prefix is
the same as `Z/nZ` but where `n` is prime, so that we are dealing with a field.

The `FlintTypes.jl` file contains the implementation of all the original FLINT types.

In the `antic` directory, `nf_elem` is for elements of a number field.

The `AnticTypes.jl` file contains the former Antic types.

In the `arb` directory the `arb` prefix is for arbitrary precision ball
arithmetic over the reals. The `acb` prefix is similar but for complex numbers.

The `ArbTypes.jl` file contains the former Arb types.

In the `calcium` directory the `ca` prefix is for exact real and complex numbers.
There is also a `qqbar` file for the field of algebraic numbers.


## Git, GitHub and project workflows

The official repositories for AbstractAlgebra and Nemo are:

<https://github.com/Nemocas/AbstractAlgebra.jl>

<https://github.com/Nemocas/Nemo.jl>

If you wish to contribute to these projects, the first step is to fork them
on GitHub. The button for this is in the upper right of the main project page.
You will need to sign up for a free GitHub account to do this.

Once you have your own GitHub copy of our repository you can push changes to
it from your local machine and this will make them visible to the world.

Before sinking a huge amount of time into a contribution, please open a ticket
on the official project page on GitHub explaining what you intend to do and
discussing it with the other developers.

The easiest way to get going with development on your local machine is to
`dev` AbstractAlgebra and/or Nemo. To do this, press the `]` key in Julia
to enter the special package mode and type:

```julia
dev Nemo
```

Now you will find a local copy on your machine of the Nemo repository in

```
.julia/dev/Nemo
```

However, this will be set up to push to the official repository instead of your
own, so you will need to change this. For example, if your GitHub account name
is `myname`, edit the `.git/config` file in your local `Nemo` directory to say:

```
        url = https://github.com/Nemocas/Nemo.jl.git
        pushurl = https://github.com/myname/Nemo.jl
```

instead of just the first line which will already be there.

It is highly recommended that you do not work in the master branch, but create
a new branch for each thing you want to contribute to Nemo.

```
git checkout -b mynewbranch
```

If your contribution is small and does not take a long time to implement,
everything will likely be fine if you simply commit the changes locally, then
push them to your GitHub account online:

```
git commit -a
git push --all
```

However, if you are working on a much larger project it is *highly* recommended
that you frequently pull from the official master branch and rebase your new
branch on top of any changes that have been made there:

```
git checkout master
git pull
git checkout mynewbranch
git rebase master
```

Note that rebasing will try to rewrite each of your commits over the top of the
branch you are rebasing on (master in this case). This process will have many
steps if there are many commits and lots of conflicts. Simply follow the
instructions until the process is finished.

The longer you leave it before rebasing on master the longer the rebase process
will take. It can eventually become overwhelming as it is not replaying the
latest state of your repository over master, but each commit that you made in
order. You may have completely forgotten what those older commits were about,
so this can become very difficult if not done regularly.

Once you have pushed your changes to your GitHub account, go to the official
project GitHub page and you should see your branch mentioned near the top of
the page. Open a pull request.

Someone will review your code and suggest changes they'd like made. Simply
add more commits to your branch and push again. They will automatically get
added to your pull request.

Note that we don't accept code without tests and documentation. We use
Documenter.jl for our documentation, in Markdown format. See our existing
code for examples of docstrings above functions in the source code and look
in the `docs/src` directory to see how these docstrings are merged into our
online documentation.

## Development list

All developers of AbstractAlgebra and Nemo are welcome to write to our
development list to ask questions and discuss development:

<https://groups.google.com/g/nemo-devel>

## Reporting bugs

Bugs should be reported by opening an issue (ticket) on the official GitHub
page for the relevant project. Please state the Julia version being used,
the machine you are using and the version of AbstractAlgebra/Nemo you are
using. The version can be found in the Project.toml file at the top level
of the source tree.

## Development roadmap

AbstractAlgebra has a special roadmap ticket which lists the most important
tickets that have been opened. If you want to contribute something high value
this is the place to start:

<https://github.com/Nemocas/AbstractAlgebra.jl/issues/492>

This ticket is updated every so often.

## Binaries

Binaries of C libraries for Nemo are currently made in a separate repository:

<https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Yggdrasil>

If code is added to any of the C libraries used by Nemo, this jll package must
be updated first and the version updated in Nemo.jl before the new
functionality can be used. Ask the core developers for help with this as
various other tasks must be completed at the same time.

## Relationship to Oscar

Nemo and AbstractAlgebra are heavily used by the Oscar computer algebra system
being developed in Germany by a number of universities involved in a large
project known as TRR 195, funded by the DFG.

Oscar is the number one customer for Nemo. Many bugs in Nemo are found and
fixed by Oscar developers and most of the key Nemo developers are part of the
Oscar project.
